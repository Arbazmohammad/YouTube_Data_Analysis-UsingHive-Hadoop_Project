# YouTube_Data_Analysis-UsingHive-Hadoop_Project


Hi, Welcome to my Git.

-> This Hadoop project involves Analysing the Youtube dataset and solving few problem statements.

-> There are multiple ways to approach this problem such as PIG, Map Reduce algorithms etc.

-> I'm using the HIVE approach. It's the most popular and widely used approach when it comes to analysing datasets within Hadoop.


Problem Statements:

A. Find out the top 5 categories with maximum number of videos uploaded.

B. Find out the top 10 rated videos.

C. Find out the most viewed videos.


In this use case, there is 1 dataset:

-> youtubedata.txt
